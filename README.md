# DMI Frontend Assignment – Hero Section

This is my submission for the **DMI.AI Frontend Developer Challenge (Round 1)**.  
I built a clean, responsive, and animated **Hero Section** using **React + Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.

---

# Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** – For fast development and hot module replacement
- **TailwindCSS** – For utility-first, responsive styling
- **Framer Motion** – For scroll-triggered and hover animations
- **ESLint** – For code consistency and linting

---

#  What I Built

-  Main headline: `"Design Made Intelligent"`
-  Sub-headline: `"From brand kit to launch-ready content, websites & apps — powered by AI."`
-  Two CTA buttons: `"Try the Demo"` and `"Join Waitlist"`
-  Fully responsive design (works on desktop + mobile)
-  Scroll fade-ins, hover interactions, and background animation using **Framer Motion**
-  Red `#e30613` used only as a visual accent for CTAs

---

##  Design & Tech Decisions

I used **TailwindCSS** to keep the layout clean and responsive, and **Framer Motion** to add subtle animations for a modern user experience. The red accent color `#e30613` was used selectively to highlight call-to-actions. Typography (Inter) was chosen for a clean and readable UI across devices.

##  ESLint Setup

Custom ESLint configuration includes:

- `@eslint/js` base rules
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` for safe React code
- `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` to prevent fast refresh bugs
- Ignores `dist/` and `build/` folders
