2) Visual Design Adjustments
I used the red color #e30613 only as an accent, mainly for the CTA buttons (“Try the Demo” and “Join Waitlist”), so it grabs attention without making the UI feel too loud.

For typography, I chose Inter because it looks clean, modern, and works well on all screen sizes. It gave the whole section a professional feel.

I added subtle animations using Framer Motion—like a fade-in on scroll, soft hover effects on buttons, and a light background pulse. These help make the section feel more alive without being distracting.

Overall, I tried to keep everything simple, responsive, and neat, focusing on good spacing, readability, and smooth interaction across devices.
